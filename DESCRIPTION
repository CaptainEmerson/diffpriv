Description: An implementation of major general-purpose mechanisms for privatizing
    statistics, models, and machine learners, within the framework of differential
    privacy of Dwork et al. (2006). Example mechanisms include the Laplace
    mechanism for releasing numeric aggregates, and the exponential mechanism for
    releasing set elements. A sensitivity sampler (Rubinstein & Alda, 2017) permits
    sampling target non-private function sensitivity; combined with the generic
    mechanisms, it permits turn-key privatization of arbitrary programs.
