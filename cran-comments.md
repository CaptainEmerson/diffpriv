## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Added identifers to the two DESCRIPTION-Description references in the proper
  format as directed. One as a doi, the other as a standard arxiv identifier as
  it is in press but on the arXiv - published but not with a doi.

## Test environments
* local win7 install, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)
* ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.4.0

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
